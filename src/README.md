# Source Layout

All executable project code lives under `src/`.

- `src/backend/`: FastAPI backend services, APIs, retrieval/agent logic, tests.
- `src/frontend/`: React + Vite web client, component tests, build config.

Top-level folders such as `docs/` and `scripts/` are intentionally kept outside
`src/` for documentation and developer tooling.
